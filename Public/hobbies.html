    <h1> A little more about me and my hobbies</h1>
    <hr />
    <p><h5>When I'm not working or learning something new, I'm usually following my natural-born curiosity — the same one that dragged me into science in the first place. I love figuring things out, asking weird questions, and falling into Wikipedia rabbit holes at 2 a.m.</p>

<p>I’m also a big fan of games — video games, board games, card games, you name it. I have a growing collection of over 60 board games (yes, it's a bit of a cardboard addiction), and I’m always up for a good strategy session or a chaotic party game night. Games are my favorite way to think creatively, have fun, and sometimes take friendly competition way too seriously.</p>

<p>Books are another obsession. I read a bit of everything — from classic literature that makes me that take me far from my own reality, exploring unfamiliar times, places, and ideas through the eyes of others to sci-fi that blows my mind and makes me question reality (in a good way). Basically, if it has words and a plot, I’ll probably read it.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget movies. I watch a lot of them. Like… a lot. From deep dramas to ridiculous comedies, I’m always adding something new to my watchlist. Feel free to judge my taste over on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ricardozocca/">Letterboxd</a>.</h5></p>
